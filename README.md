WIM Virtual Decentralised P2P Crowd Funding White Paper
A: DEFITIONS:
DP2P CF refers to a Decentralised Peer to Peer Crowd Funding.

This happens when two or more individuals known as Peers put their funds together to fund each other.

Why Peer to Peer? This is caused by the fact that individuals eliminate a master servant, centralized way where

one person/company controls Peers and is paid by Peers for borrowing Peer funds for their projects.

Virtual refers to the fact that Peers across borders or continents meet and interact via an online platform

and use Internet and Communications Technologies to exchange messages and trade.

D: OWNERSHIP:
There is no easily defined ownership of the Virtual Decentralised P2P because all Peers are free to join and leave

at any time they feel like. Central feature of the virtual DP2P is financial donations and because these are routed via

virtually via a website to Peers, this eliminates central ownership, centralization and even the ability to control Peers.

Every Participant be it an administrator or developer or marketer is a Peer Entity.

E:LEGALITY/LEGIT/Misconceptions:
In spite the fact that it is decentralized and owner less, freedom of expression, association and the freedom to

willingly, knowingly and freely donating and being donated to by legal aged individuals, it is well protected by democracy.

People often mistakenly take all decentralized financial schemes as illegal Ponzi/Pyramid fraudulent schemes. The entire Crypto

a defined platform way of operating and willingly and freely donate what they can afford to donate.

Because Virtual DP2P by its nature is decentralized and lack an authority with an ability to make every participant

honest, then scamming innocent people by some individuals takes place.

Powerful social media groups screen platform information and monitor suspicious operations alerting members and in so

doing misrepresentation of information.

G:BENEFICIARIES AND LOSERS:
Any Peer can be a beneficiary and any Peer can be a loser. The higher the risk one takes the higher the return when it comes.

It is volatile, subscriptions can grow and drop quickly because it based on speculation. Earnings via referral links and

Consulting Services can offset loses via donations.

This is a less risk financial operations compared to national lotto where millions of money is won by 1 person. In a Virtual

DP2P there is a higher number of members gaining and a higher probability of realising one's dream because members are

socially influenced to bless or be blessed willingly, knowingly and freely.

H:INFLUENCERS AND POWERS:
Normally recruiters, platform creators, big investors or risk takers, originators have a degree of influence and

power but do not underrate an ordinary Participant who decides to donate of not to donate and social media groups

also have power and influence to change operations.
