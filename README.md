Virtual Decentralised P2P Crowd Funding White Paper

A: DEFITIONS:

P2P means Peer to Peer. It is a group of people with equal status. 
Virtual refers to a form of interaction that takes place online.
Decentralized means control is distributed to Peers.
White Paper is a document that describe a project.
Crowd Funding means that money is sources from a group of people.

B: AIM OF VIRTUAL DECENTRALIZED P2P CF

Having explained terms now it is easy to move on looking at aims of raising money using this
scheme.

The aims of Virtual Decentralised P2P are:

- solve problems created by Centralized Funding namely: 

a) excludes a significant group of populations those with identity problems, the blacklisted, those with poor credit
ratings and so on.
b) Centralization is secure but very slow and required one to operate with the working hours of the banks. They lack
flexibility.
c) Centralization has many charges and procedures which a Peer to Peer scheme eliminates. One central repository of 
funds is the target of attach and if attach is successful huge funds are lost. This is true with Centralized Stockvels too.
d) P2P scheme is quick, is done anywhere and any time.

Other aims are:

- help each other with finances via free donations and broaden the scope of crowd schemes.
- uplift social and economic status of Peers nationally and internationally.
- minimize volatility and risk.
- create jobs.

C: OBJECTIVES:

- eliminate delays in Peer to Peer financing. Helping each other quickly without the problem of credit checks
and personal verifications.
- fast, easy and inexpensive interactions and communications. Join, Create dream, get Order, Donate quickly
where ever a Peer is. Eliminates the need to travel to a central place and be subjected to credit worthy judicial panel.
- boost social and psychological states of Peers in social media groups. Common messages like "I have blessed someone today",
"I have been blessed", "Here is my free donation", etc and the virtual social appreciations for actions accomplished.
- bridge digital gap by putting to good use ICT technologies.
- integrate with main stream financial systems.

D: OWNERSHIP, ADMINISTRATION STAFF, SERVICE PROVIDING STAFF:

Almost all Participants of P2P schemes do not want accountability and ownership because each Peer is directly linked 
to the other Peer, funds are personally exchanged without a middle man. The moment it is owned by a person, a company or group
of people then it ceases being decentralized.

Like a church, Virtual DP2P is not owned by a single company or individual otherwise that individual or company must get it registered as a Financial Institution, then follow all legal requirements include FICA, AWL, paying tax. For this to happen P2P ceases to exist because all Peers now must be accountable to the demands of the owner and must pay donations to the owner who in turn regulates and complies to legal requirements. If an individual or company does collect all money from Peers and fails to fulfill Peer demands then this is a pure Ponzi scheme that enriches the individual or company.

Virtual DP2P administrators names Community Guadians CGs do not own the Virtual DP2P project. Similarly the Service Providers like IT Staff, Fund Keepers, Support Staff, Consulting Staff[Marketers], etc do not own the project and are not liable for its success or failure. These provide essential services which make the Virtual DP2P function. Without them no even one person will be helped.

These must be regulated in a fair and transparent manner so that they are motivated to continue giving their badly needed services.

E:LEGALITY/LEGIT/Misconceptions:

In spite the fact that it is decentralized and owner less, freedom of expression, association and the freedom to
willingly, knowingly and freely donate and be donated to by legally aged individuals, 
it is well protected by any country democracy.

People often mistakenly take all decentralized financial schemes as illegal Ponzi/Pyramid fraudulent schemes. 
The entire Crypto world and ecosystem reverses centralization, promotes anonymous operations 
and transactions and challenge traditional financial systems and standards

These are very popular and are growing quickly because of the benefits they give to society.

Some of the benefits are listed below:
-Fast, inexpensive and convenient financial operations. Well big companies and some governments have 
 joined the Bitcoin world.
-Virtual Decentralised P2P is a new crowd funding scheme that is based on free donor donation to 
 realize your fellow Peer's dream and is becoming a popular easy financing scheme amidst internet 
 scams, fraud. At some point in time, the law will find a way of dealing with it the same way 
 it will find a way of dealing with Bitcoin or Gambling.

F: SCAM:

"A fraudulent scheme performed by a dishonest individual, group, or company in an attempt obtain 
money or something else of value. Scams traditionally resided in confidence tricks, where an individual 
would misrepresent themselves as someone with skill or authority, i.e. a doctor ... "
[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/scam.html]

Virtual DP2P Crowd Funding communities need the following to be out of scam parameters:

-eliminate dishonest and misinformation and unnecessary anonymous operations. When an adult gambles his/her 
 salary away in a Casino it is not a scam because of these principles: knowledge, freedom, will and legal age 
 are there. Participating Peers read Terms and Conditions and agree to the platform rules.
 
 Examples of scams:
 
 https://www.iol.co.za/dailynews/probe-into-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-13543805

 https://businesstech.co.za/news/technology/228769/hawks-investigating-multi-million-rand-bitcoin-scam-in-south-africa-report/

 https://www.thesouthafrican.com/btc-global-what-is-cryptocurrency/
 
 BTC global banked their bitcoins on one person and one person was the Pay Master. This has one big point of failure.
 
 Virtual DP2P makes everyone a Fund Keeper meaning after being confirmed as a donor a Peer is given Funds to keep. This prevents  all funds going to one bank account.
 
 By the above definition of a scam Virtual DP2P does not have central control but distributed specialized duties, does not misrepresent information because there are rules clearly defined, terms and conditions clearly defined, and a white paper with the philosophy of the p2p donation project. Since there are not contracts written or implied than requirements for joining and functioning as a full member there is no individual or company or group to take to court for scam or fraud. Fraudsters are blocked and if the administration does not deliver as expected pressure groups check on them or members quickly exit.

G: BENEFICIARIES AND LOSERS:

Any Peer can be a beneficiary and any Peer can be a loser. The higher the risk one takes the higher the 
return when it comes. It is volatile, subscriptions can grow and drop quickly because it based on 
speculation. Earnings via referral links and Consulting Services can offset loses via donations.

This is a less risk financial operations compared to national lotto where millions of money is won by 1 person. 
In a Virtual DP2P there is a higher number of members gaining and a higher probability of realising one's dream 
because members are socially influenced to bless or be blessed willingly, knowingly and freely.

H: INFLUENCERS AND POWERS:

Normally recruiters, platform creators, big investors or risk takers, originators have a degree of influence and
power but do not have an ability to control every body because power and finance is decentralized.

I 1): FEATURES:

i) 	Platform - website for virtual operations.
ii) Participants - Peers to donate and be donated to.
iii)Services:

a) 	Fund Keeping Donation[FKD] - This is a service from Peers to keeps funds for the community. Any confirmed Peer qualifies.
	Confirmed means a Participant has completed a verifiable service to build a community e.g. donated, developed 
	website, marketed.
b) 	Consulting Services [CS]- traditionally members were tasked with MLM recruitment but this has evolved 
	to Consulting Services where Down linkers[DL] are assisted as per need until they are independent.
c) 	System Services[SS] - without a web applications being built and maintained the Decentralised P2P ceases to be virtual.
d) 	Mediatory Services[MS] - Social media groups are managed by Peers whose effort should be acknowledged as [MS].
e) 	Financial Services[FK] - These are much needed funds from Peers donated by Financial Service Givers to fund Peer
	dreams. This also includes escrow[ES] services where Fund Keepers are not available and not reliable.
f) 	Other Service Providers [OSP]- These could be counselling[CoS], legal[LeS], spiritual[SpS], educational service[EdS] providers

I 2): RISKS AND DISADVANTAGES:

This type of funding is similar to gambling. A Participant is not donated to unless and until 
he/she has donated to the community or to a Peer and has been confirmed. The donation made
is done freely, willingly and knowing that it might not have returns but has a speculative 
element of high returns. Donation is not only money, but services too.

Why call it donation not gambling or something like lotto? In gambling, there is a very low probability of wining. In
this P2P donor donated fund raising scheme, there is guaranteed returns to many participants. Lotto is 
pure gambling blessed by law. It has the highest risk ever and millions of lotto players have lost millions of 
money without getting anyone arrested.

The principle of collecting money from many participants to fund a few has been criticised to a point 
that these schemes have evolved to socio-economic models of donor-donated rather that 
investments schemes with ROI.

I 3): TAX EVASION:

The Virtual Decentralized P2P does not evade tax. It is not a company with income. Participants in their own 
capacity need to solve tax issues as they do with FICA, Know Your Customer in their Peer to Peer financial 
transactions and in their own national laws. It is easy. If ones' donation is doubled or tripled and the person or 
company meets tax requirements then issue of Tax evasion false away.

Since each Peer is fully empowered then it is the Peer who is responsible for all these. Do not equate Virtual Decentralized P2P
to an entity but to a movement to help others with needed funds quickly.

However, Peers should be educated and helped to follow laws and taxes as all other entities of state including 
churches and NPOs.

I 4): SHORT LEAVED SCHEMES:

Pyramid Schemes and Scam website have been known to be short leaved and to close when there is high demand for 
payouts. Virtual Decentralized P2P Crowd Funding is not money focused but addresses a social key problem and then 
creates a community that grows forever. For example, Women In Move tackles the problem of underrating women and empowering
them socially and economically. 

If adopted by all governments and by all women and supported by all men Women In Move will leave forever.

Embracing the spiritual and social virtues of giving - donating as well
as the economic need to bless other people and see them succeed financial, WIM and its philosophy not only 
breed millionaires but millionaires out of socially and economically disadvantaged groups.

I 5): HOW WILL THIS BE POSSIBLE:

Virtual Decentralized P2P uses cycles and phases, round robin donations, advanced Fund Keeping and advanced payouts to minimized bottle necks

. Re-donating, prioritized services, eliminating greediness, and creating loyal Peers are but a few ways to 
circumvent quick crashes.

Integrations with Crypto Coin, Peer directed donations and integration with all possible decentralized
financial schemes.

All existing stockvels can double their savings by also enlisting in this scheme to be donated to. This will also 
boost the Virtual Decentralized P2P Crowd Fund Venture.

I 6): SCOPE OF DONATION:

Financial donations are the base but not the only essential donations. Other donations badly needed are in form of 
services: Financial Advice, Counselling, Legal, Spiritual, Business Networking, Educational, Marketing, ICT, etc.

I 7): REMUNERATIONS AND SALARIES:

Since by its nature the P2P is not centralized and has no one central pool to keep donations. All costs for  services and products are met via donations. Not via salaries. It is common and a bad practise for origionators, leaders, or controllers to pay themselves millions underground without objectively qualifying that and worse hiding it form other Peers. 

The VD P2P needs to evolve and be transparant. It should avoid what could be likened to : Officials creating a match in which they are player referees. A match where they award themselves not even penalties, but scores. This is where the public cry foul and call these ventures scams and fraud.

If one person risks and donates 1 million. It is clear that this amount will bless a lot of participants for some months and depending on a platform, the person may in turn be donated 2 million. There is no need to disclose these Peers because privacy and anonymity are values of VD P2P. However, it is not fare for a person who calls himself/herself a leader without contributing  or with minimal contribution to demand a million out of thin air.This is an indirect way of scaming/defrauding the other Peers. 

It is a different case if a service provider provides critical services to the community and demands to be properly looked after because the platform will not exist and Peers will not benefit if those services are not rendered. He/She/They is/are the pillar/s of the community. This is inclusive of the support Peers.

The crypto currency ecosystem has made developers millonnaires, miners millionnaires, exchanges millionnaires and traders millionnires but no one complains because there is a degree of transparency. Same with VD P2P it can also function the same because all these are decentralised financial schemes. There ought to be a declared service way of being donated to rather than to operate in the dark. Please note that service providers do not own the scheme just like developers, miners and exchanges do not own the bitcoin or the cryptocurrency.

This should be good news to those that want to invest in VD P2P such as WIM. Investment here is not limited to finance, but critical services as defined above.

It will always be hard to confront various organization for transparancy with this regard. As a start proposing a 20-25% of monthly transactions to be monthly remuneration for system staff, system operational costs such as data, sms etc is one way of being transparent. It is better than unknown and undeclared payments to those origionators and admin personnel.

Recruitment is promoted via 10% earnings and every one is happy with this and so why not be happy with 20 - 25% of monthly transactions to look after those system developers. Without system and its technical staff the Virtual Decentralized P2P will not work. This therefore will transform VD P2P CF to a Transparent platform.

J: PEER SECURITY, ANONYMITY AND INTEGRITY AND REFUNDS:

The crypto world employ computer science tools to hash identities and thus achieve anonymity of members because by being public Peers can be hijacked or robbed. Virtual Decentralized P2P members are adviced to create different names best names that are not on social media, create different emails.

The account name and surname should be different. Email should be correct but a new email that is not on social media. Use new trading bank accounts specific to this activity. Should one tries to stalk an account, it should be difficult  but details for Peers to contact each other should be correct. Let us illustrate this:

I open an account using Dirty Pastor, register an email voetleng@gmail.com and use a correct RICAed cell and correct bank account but of my cousin at FNB. Create dream, donate, and get it confirmed. When Peers call to confirm your details, they need not worry that the account name is not the account holder name. The only Know Your Customer needed here is verify that the account holder knows the order and that the order is correct from the system depatched. This is important because, Peers are in different countries and again Peers must not follow to claim their donations back.

If they need refund, they log a call via the system and if there is a good reason to refund the Peer will be allocated someone else to donate to them and Peer will be blocked forever. Refunds violate the principle of donation and also the principle of  donating with what you can afford to lose. There is no one who went after lotto organizers claiming for a refund. Four cardinal principles in a Virtual Decentralized P2P: a) Knowledge, b) Free Will, c) legal Age, d) Will. 

Platform staff, support and other service providers like marketing or CS have no liability to loss incurred by any Peer. Why? It works the same way as lotto staff be it developers, workers, support or staff of a cassino are not held liable for a gamblers' lose or win. 

Take it the other way, suppose a Peer who started with R200 ends up with R18000. A staff member confronts the Peer and claims a significant share in R18000 because he/she provided services and support to make Peer win. This will not work because it violates rules of the community. The same way, no Peer should request for refund or be refunded on perceived loss.

Another good reason to respect transactions and never ask for refunds: A gets paid by B who gets paid by C who also gets paid by D, E and F. These transactions are a network and not easy to reverse. Therefore no refunds. No follow up on Peers. No threats to Peers. Play the game to accept either a win or a lose.

If a Peer has already been donated to, then the Peer cannot claim full amount he/she donated. Whatever he/she donated must be subtracted from his/her total donations to community and whatever remains the Peer must be donated back half the amount. This is because of administrative costs and inconvenience and complecations of P2P funding. This is meant to also deter members playing around with community members and trying to take advantage of the community and system. This does not apply to genuinely proven cases where the member was erroneously allocated or underpaid.

Admin must investigate thoroughly the Peer requesting for refund to avoid double payments and to avoid scammers. It should be completed within 2 weeks so that anyone with a case again a leaving Peer has enough time to bring his/her case.

However, genuine losses caused by system allocatons or support can be compensated by routing new donations to affected Peers.

Distributing profile information of Peers with images as a deterrent to fraud or scam is not professional and violates Peer commitments to privacy and Non Disclosure of identities and information. Verbal abuse or abuse of any nature on the cyber space is also unprofessional and undermines Peer to Peer respect. Peer to Peer interactions are always suspecious. The true identities of online Peers is impossible to aunthenticate and verify. 

What makes it even more difficult is the fact that one individual can have multiple internet identities with differenct profile images. Most profile images are collages edited to potray certain characters. Even if one Peers feels he/she knows where a Peer lives, works, etc. Face it there is no way we can prove the Peer made an internet transaction. It could be a friend or group of people of child or someone. This therefore defines a Virtual Decentralized P2P as a trustless community. Paradoxically, it works efficiently and functions like a trustful community regulated by  judiciary, executive and administrative organs.

K: ALLOCATION & PAYMENTS

Normally the default expected donations allocations procedure is First Come First Serve FCFS. Meaning those that got confirmed first will have their dreams paid for first.

This has a problem. There is a tendence of first 3 months or so registered members to monopolize the platform by creating many dreams each leading to the rest of the months members joining later to be only donors. The rule that anyone can create as many dreams as he/she wishes is good but the allocation procedure should embrace fairness by running a Round Robin First Confirmed First Serve [RRFCFS]. This will encourage Peers to feel more secure joining in later months and will also spread benefits to more Peers.

Since the rate of new members joining is finite over a given period and the reinvestment of those donated to is not gauranteed, introducing phases and cycles where the previously disadvanted Peers become frontliners of new phases/cycles will not only minimize catastrophic loss of late comers but also ensure that the P2P runs forever.

Services such as counselling of transitional members and also supporting them will be very vital and will also boost the P2P. The P2P will then be a P2P with a Peer Conscience. A P2P with well informed members, members with a conscience to Tax needs, members with an ethical and social dimension. Non governmental organizations are free to donate to these P2P or to work hand in hand with them because pure donations are root activity of Virtual Decentralized P2P.

Another boost will be, later comers who recruit have their refferral earnings paid first since their dreams are at the end of the queue.

Payments normally run well within first months and then begin to face challenges later. This is caused by the speculative nature of the P2P and by drying recruitment channels. P2P should evolve from being a do or die investment game into a social engagement something like a friendly match in which players play the game for its social and happiness purposes.

How can this be done? Eliminate hard and fast rules with regards 100%, 90%, 80%  etc returns when times are hard  and introduce them to boost P2P when it is in boom. Understand there are times when people have money and times when people do not have money.

All must appreciate that P2P is by far the best wide spread funding ever to exit although it will not fund all its members.

L: CONTRACTS:

Virtual operations like membership is made upon joining the platform. Joining signals commitment to rules and conditions to ensure fairness. Abitration and punitive measures for not adhering to expected rules and conditions is done virtually because members do not physically meet. Consensus on the group is important and is exercised via donations and social group votes.

M: BANK ACCOUNTS, WIM ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS JUSTIFICATIONS:

Different bank accounts can be used by one person but each WIM account will need a new cell number and a new email. The bank account used need not be the bank account of the WIM account holder because one can open an account for grandmother or grandfather  or for a relative in rural areas or a relative without a bank account.

Peers can also send money to each other quickly via e-wallet or bitcoin as long as on system the paid Peer confirms that he/she received the money and can provide proof with a screen shot.

Remember no one will confirm another Peer without receiving the money and Peer allocations is determined randomnly. Therefore, this is secure, flexible and helps reach out many people in rural areas.

Peers handle transactions between themselves and using their own bank accounts. Peers can be companies or other stockvels too. 
Banks and Financial regulatory bodies block bank accounts who transactions are not clearly defined. Financial transactions are for services rendered and received by Peers. These are outlined above in section I.iii).

N: FUNDS KEEPING:

Each Peer is to open and operate a Fund Keeper account. It is a good move to make this compulsory. Only WIM Funds Kept will be in this type of account. At any moment the WIM Admin can request a bank statement from this account for these reasons:
- to make sure community funds kept are available,
- to track paid orders,
- to track dream payments and bonus paments,
- to promote member self descipline with regard savings.

The Funds Kept by Peer will be released as Peer payment for matured dreams. The withdrawal of these funds must enter the dream reference number.

Disciplined and good Fund Keepers will be allowed to keep even more Funds than their donations but security must be in place to prevent loss of Funds.

Advantages: 

- this eliminates few people keeping funds for all Peers and eliminates loss of funds from a single point of funds repository such as Bank Account being hacked etc.
- distributed Fund Keeping eliminates payments bottlenecks at any point in time such as during festive seasons. This has been the cause of many platforms closing. 
- this will encourage new members to join as there is security.

Disadvantages:
- grannies and other Peers may not have bank accounts. Leaders must assist these with this problem. These may apply for Fund Keeping exemptions.

Fund Keeping Booster Allocations [FKBA] - is an adhoc preferential orders creation where the selected Peers usually those with big dreams or Special Consulting Services are allocated more funds to their FK pocket. Admin normally do this in advance but where a Peer feels he/she needs more funds is welcome to apply.

O: GROUP LEADERS:

Group leaders are Peers who create groups online, educate Peers, do consulting, register new members and look after them so that they benefit from the community donations and bonuses. 

Peers get blocked for unpaid orders, get delayed in allocations due other factors and the most common problem is digital divide.  We have good technology users and others with good smart devices but lack skills of using these. This there fore requires collaboration and coordination at a lower level.

Group Management is a good service that must be recognized because without it a significate community population is left behind. This may cause members to leave the group. Thus, GM is to be compensated for via free data etc.

P: CLEAN AND UNCLEAN ACCOUNTS vs REWARD AND PUNISHMENT AND REDEMPTION

Peers who do not pay orders for whatever reasons make their accounts unclean. This inconveniences other Peers and so these accounts must be blocked. Those clean accounts should be rewarded. Blocking alone is not enough but a redemption option must be implemented so that once an account has been redeemed it becomes clean. This can be done by allowing unclean accounts to create Redemption Dreams with less reward such as 50% instead of 100%.

Q: ADMIN INDEMNTY

Resolving problems of delaying confirmation and failure to upload proof of payment by admin is meant to make processes move quickly and fairly. Peers should login and also check their accounts that the proof of payment uploaded by admin or the confirmed member is indeed genuine. If fault is found, they must contact admin to reverse the process because they will be fund keepers of money they did not receive.

Admin will not be held liable for these errors because they have no means to verify that the money is in the paid bank account.

R: AUTOMATIC RE-INVESTMENT OF 30% MATURED DREAMS.

Big dreams may receive automatic re-investment of 30% in order to suppport continued donations to fellow Peers. But the re-invested amount will also grow and benefit owners like all other dreams. Keeping the flow of donations running without stop is the goal to benefit many.

M: ZERO INTEREST LOANS AGAINST DREAMS: ZILAD:

Helping elligible Peers with loans(ZERO INTEREST LOANS AGAINST DREAMS[ZILAD]) against their dreams during festive seasons or during times of needs where possible is a service which will benefit members of P2P. Peers may borrow against their dreams and only clean confirmed accounts may be considered. If the loan is not repaid and the dream matures, then the dream will be less that borrowed donation amount. No interest should be charged to these because they are donations from Peers and are also an incentives for Peers to keep Clean Accounts[CA].

N: P2P PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION SKILLS:

Peers are from all different professions: doctors, educators, national security officers, IT specialist, business managers, cooperative managers and so on and are also from different backgrounds and from different races and nationalities. It is important to communicate positively, truthfully and politely. New members are most fearful and can quickly withdraw at any moment they feel unsafe and insecure.

By virtue of being an online community great care should be taken by all Peers to use every effort to communicate in a professional manner.

Peers should be patient, good listeners, polite, positive, confident, factual than emotional, quick to respond. Should call back all missed calls, leave voice notes to non available Peers and NEVER discredit other Peers on social media groups. Use official email to send queries about a particular Peer NEVER use social media groups. Chances are many that you do not have sufficient facts.

The reason is discrediting other Peers publicly may  prevent genuine pending orders from being fulfilled.

O: DREAM MATURITY DONATION RECEIVED [DMDR]

Matured dreams have a target maturity value. Peers undertake willingly, freely, and knowingly to fulfill the maturity value because every confirmed Peer has at least one dream to achieve.

When dream matures, first donation for the maturity value comes from Funds Kept by the relavant Peer. If the Peer is Keeping Funds more than the dream maturity value then the dream gets donated to from Funds Kept. This is quick and safe.

If the Funds Kept falls short of the dream maturity value then short fall gets donated to by the Peers via orders created from new dreams or via other quick safe means avalaible.

If Fund Keeping proceedures have been followed properly the realization of matured dreams should not be a problem and this will create confidence in all members.

O: INDOSAKUSA - THE MORNING STAR - DREAMS CASH OUT

Emergencies that required immediate funding and cannot be postponed can be met by Indosakusa Dreams Surrender.  In simple terms eventualities like death, property reposession, blacklisted, evicted from house - no rent! and so on can be funded by letting the applicant surrender his/her dreams for badly needed cash.

Eligibility: member must be at least 30 days, have created multiple dreams 3, dreams created on different days, of different periods, dreams of different amounts, each dream at least R2000, have consulted and brought in at least 15 members and pledges to be with WIM forever.

Procedure: WIM via Admin will create Indosakusa dreams, from those dreams get orders which are assigned to admin to out dreams of Indosakusa applicants. Successful applicants will surrender their dreams and in turn donated to badly needed cash to be used for funeral, saving car/house from being repossessed. These surrendered dreams will not belong to WIM Admin but to WIM and will grow to maturity and the maturity amounts will be for WIM most needy members: Grannies, pay essential WIM essential services like International Financial Routers[IFRs] or those WIM Low Benefit Index[A ratio which measures how much benefit a member got from being a WIM Member].

How much cash? The Total Donations for those dreams made plus 33% of Total Donations. E.g. Peer A made Total Donation of 45000 and will qualify for at most R45000 Plus R14850.00(33% of 45000).

Frequency: One benefit per successful applicant per annual.

Benefits: This will create long term WIM membership and loyalty and value in all communities. This will further boost the benevolent spirit amoung Donors and the Donated : The Blessers and The Blessed.

Short Falls: Successful applicants are helped in times of need but lose their dreams and their maturity to the community. Peers can create new dreams and get confirmed on these after benefiting from Indosakusa Dreams Cash Out.

P: FINANCIAL ROUTERS [FR] 

FR - is a service offered by Peers in different countries. The service is about routing funds global within the shortest possible time. FR will earn 10% of the amount they quickly converted and routed. For example: Peer A in country X has an order to pay Peer B R5000 in country Y. Country X has an FR named XFR and country Y has also an FR named YFR. Both XFR and YFR are confirmed members with significant dreams.

Peer A pays XFR R5000 who in turn sends a message via whatsapp/sms/email to YFR to pay YFR an equivalent of R5000 in Y currency.
Both XFR and YFR will be paid 10% of the amount they each route correctly and quickly. If they fail, delay, or do not do it correctly they are penalised by paying WIM 10% of the failed amount because someone else will have to do the Funds Routing quickly.

This will make donations reach simple Peers in different countries quickly.

Q: PAY MEMBER [PM]

This is a service where by selected Peers distribute donations for Matured Dreams, Consulting Services  or Bonuses CSDs. This service solves the problem emanating from having many people  waiting to be paid small amounts and having few big dreams donations. 

For example: We have 2410 people to be donated to amounts varying from R200 to R4000 and having say 7 x R30000 dreams. To match up 2410 amounts to be paid, Pay Master run special accounts with dreams specifically created to pay.

Admin distributes big dreams to PM and PM pay Peers and get confirmed by paid Peers. Pay Masters will be monitored by Pay Member Supervisors [PMS] whose duty will be to listen to the unpaid Peers and help them get paid. PMS quality check the PM and help them during high demands to distribute donations quickly and correctly.

R:WALL of FIRE | RING of FIRE [Wof|RoF]

Peers are very much unreliable and especially the new ones and those who have nothing to lose. They created dreams and based on their speculative judgements and feelings withdraw from paying resulting orders.

This causes unpaid Peers to ask for re-allocations.

Problems: DMDR, CSD, FKA that are queued to be donated to have to be suspended until the re-allocations are done. This creates delays and a social media feeling of plartform instability.

Solutions: To protect Peers and ensure re-allocations stop, a Wall of Fire is to be made. 

How will it works: All new members  must be screened by Wall of Fire Members. Their dreams will create orders to be paid to Wall of Fire Members. The WFM will screen and get the new ones donate at least 3 times and be donated to at least 3 times. If a Peer succeeds to conform to WF then the Peer will join the WIM community and should the peer fail to honor orders within the community then the Peer dreams will be used to fund re-allocations.

Peers offering Ring of Fire Service will earn 2.5% for every lost funds they manage to get. For example, X Peer refuses to honor his/her donation to Y Peer. Let us say the amount involved was R5000. If the RoF/WoF Member who manages to convince Peer Y to donate is paid 2.5% of the R5000.

When RoF service is in place, all re-allocations will be sent to them and they will deal with the situation.

Eligibility to be a RFM - Ring of Fire Members: Confirmed Peers, Clean accounts, at least 30 days with WIM, more than 5 dreams of different dates, dreams different amounts: Continual Investor.

S:WALL of FIRE Extended Services | RING of FIRE Extended Services [WoFXS|RoFXS]

The speculative nature of a virtual DP2P can crash the whole system if it builds mistrust amoung members. This is evident when lots of orders are not settled. 
To avoid this RoFXS is created to consult with these with an aim to create trust. Members who will offer this service will be paid 10% of the outstanding order amount. They will get a list of defaulters and call them on orders not settled.

For example if a Peer got scared and cancelled settling an amount of R10000.00.  If a RoFXS officer consults with this peer and the peer changes his/her mind and pays the order:To Pay Members and Admin accounts, then the RoFXS is donated to R1000 for a successful service. This is so because now the other amount is available to settle DMDRs, CSDs, and FKDs. Only PM and Admin accounts will be donated to by defaulters. The defaulters account will be unblocked and their relevant dreams will be confirmed and will start growing.

Who can be a RoFXS?
This service is for all confirmed members only. Be a Faithful Disciple of WIM and convince scepticals that WIM is here to benefit many people.

T: SALVATION DREAMS: 

When defaulting Peers are blocked and if it happens that they are many, the unpaid orders are in fact lost donations and this will affect matured dream payments and other needed services. To save the situation, all members will be requested to willingly, freely, and knowingly donate a fixed reasonable amount by creating dreams called Salvation Dreams. These are normal dreams and will mature and be paid like all other dreams.

This will raise the needed amount to cover matured dreams. 

U: PREFERENTIAL MATURED DREAM DONATIONS:

Members who are active, confirmed, who recruit a lot, offer services and who always donate to WIM via creating multiple dreams may will be given preferential treatment when it comes to various donations.

This is to eliminate lazy Peers and to reward hard working members.

V: DMDR CSD BOOSTED CASHOUT[DCBC] & FKA CSD BOOSTED CASH[FCBC]

Problem: 

As a community grows, some members donate very few dreams aimed at maturing with big returns. For example, they create say a R200 dream for 5 months and pay it. 

Then sit and wait for it mature for R6400 without them recruiting at all. WIM has been paying these people their matured dreams this is straining the very few 3% who are recruiting. This is a fact which all members of a stockvel must appreciate because Growing Dreams To Maturity means getting new dreams created to fund the daily growing queue of maturing dreams.

At least members should do either a continuous recruitment or a continuous dream creation or a continuous community service so that the Communal Benevolent Spirit keeps funds flowing to benefit all.

Do not mistake a P2P Donor Donated Community to an investment coorperative where all funds are invested and get interests. Those funds are used normally to build rental offices and houses and in turn generate the interest members receive which is very small compared to P2P donations.

Solution:

Shaking up members and motivating them to be active can be done by introducing  dream maturity donations based on recruitment to confirmed members so we have a 97% active community rather than only 3% recruiters. This is known as DMDR CSD BOOSTED CASHOUT[DCBC].

Many members are ego centric meaning they argue that they donated and therefore they should also be donated at all cost. This is the ideal situation we are all fighting for. However, decentralization strip out the ability to force donations the same way insurances force premium payments. The tool available now to be used is DCBC and is not the only one.

How will it work?

All members with matured dreams not maturing dreams, will have to race and recruit. All those they will find and are confirmed will fund their matured dreams by 40%. Let us say Peer A has a matured dream worthy R40000. Peer A Consults and registers 4 members who donate dreams amounts equivalent to say R26000. Peer A will get 10% from these for CSD cash payout and then get 40% of R26000 which is R10400 on top of the CSD R2600(x2 on Winter Double Bonus). The remaining 40% will be used for Fund Keeping [60% of the remaining 40%] and rest for admin operational costs to keeping community secure and healthy.

Another Problem: What if the Peer has no matured dream?

FKA CSD BOOSTED CASH[FCBC] is the option for those without matured dreams or those whose matured dreams are all paid up.  What is FKA CSD BOOSTED CASH[FCBC] and how does it work?

FKA CSD BOOSTED CASH[FCBC] is a Fund Keeping Donation for those that have recruited. Peers will have their Down Liners dreams allocated to admin and Pay Members and these will in turn boost DL Fund Keeping Amount as follows: 

All members will race and recruit. All those they will find and are confirmed will Fund Keeping Amount by 40%. Let us say Peer A has a dream worthy R5000. Peer A Consults and registers say 2 members who donate dreams amounts equivalent to say R3000. Peer A will get 10% from these for CSD cash payout and then get 40% of R3000 which is R1200 on top of the CSD R300(x2 on Winter Double Bonus). The remaining percentage will be used for admin operational costs, Pay Member Services and RoFXS services: to keeping community secure and healthy.

Benefits:

This will be fair to Confirmed Recruiters. All other dreams will be paid as donations. Non recruiters or non Continual Donors will be have their matured dreams processed the normal way and can still get ZILAD against them.

Those who cannot recruit then they should create small many dreams in different times or offer critical services like RoFXS, Pay Members, etc.

This will also eliminate the biggest problem of Late Comer Big Loser [LCBL]. If someone joins after 10 months, he/she will not be disadvantage because his/her payments will be made immediately up to 60% and still have the remainder paid later.

No more waiting for dream payments delayed by non recruiters. No more unfairness burdening 3% to recruit for all. The true principle of growing your dream will be implemented and realized.

Challenges:

Members may not like this because it is coming at a time their dreams have matured and others have been already paid. The success of Salvation Week show that members understand that virtual community are dynamic. What should happen is listen and try to help all affected members rather than ignore and flush them out. All must also appreciate that every brick in a house is important and needs to be fairly treated.

The issue of members to be paid by their downlines is gonna bring huge
problems too cause if one is going to recruit from where she/he stays n all
the recruited ppl are paying her/him,this can cause a serious trouble if
their turn of matured dreams has to be paid n they haven't managed to
recruit, this means they are not going to be paid n they are gonna comeback
to the person who recruited them n demand refunds,this can resultingin law
suits.

W: DMDR FKA CASHOUT via ADVERTISEMENTS[DFCA]

Problem: DCBC means Peers are to recruit and get their matured dreams or fund keeping paid out. But not everybody can recruit members to join. If you cannot recruit members to join WIM because the recruited are cynical then find companies or individuals with online purchasable products and services like Vodacom, MTN to come and advertise on our WIM platform and groups. These companies will be charged an affordable fee and have their products adversed on our community areas. 

Stockvels similar to ours are not allowed to advertise in our communities because this is conflicting with our services and will disrupt and confuse our members.

DFCA Members will be Peers selected from WIM using our criteria to coordinate the company recruiters. Any one can apply to be a DFAM and if selected will earn 10% of every amount a company pays for advertising. 40% will be paid towards your dream maturing or fund keeping.

Most companies with products and services are looking for communities to introduce their products. Our community is one platform with many members - 5000.
We want all matured genuine dreams of all our members paid. This will increase trust in WIM.

How to do it?

1. Find advertisers
2. Admin will approve content to be advertised
3. Members will be informed of approved companies or individuals and products
4. The recruiter will then join that company/individual under his/her link, login to that company/individual and create a R1000 dream. An order will be produced for that company to pay. When that order is paid and confirmed, then the content of the company will be published on our communities.
The recruiter gets paid the same way via DCBC for her matured dream
That company's dream will not be a growing dream but a DFCA dream to facilitate payment of recruiter dreams.

X: DMDR ZERO PAID MEMBERS[DZPM]

At any stockvel there will be zero paid members. WIM eliminates this by Fund Keeping Amounts FKA, but still there will be members whos  matured dreams have never been paid. Strategies to avoid this are needed because these Peers are the one who paid previous dreams. It is not fair that their dreams are not paid at all. This is a membership retention strategy. A list of these will be drawn and these will be paid and all will be notified and requested to cooperate and assist with this strategy.

Group Leaders and Up Liners have a duty to fight and ensure that all their Down Liners matured dreams receive payments. If no more dreams are created and no new members join then like Salvation Week, an effort from existing members must be done to eliminate DZPM.

Y: FREE REGISTRASTIONS CSD [FR CSD]

Why is recruiting difficult now than before? Many people have been disappointed by many scams that reaped them their money with false promises. This cynicism will not go away. It gets worse when messages of unpaid dreams or partial dream payments are exchanged even if there is a good explanation for delays.

There is a way around this problem on those people interested but sceptical. This is free registrations with no mandate to create dreams. One might ask what would be the reason to join. It is for the following benefits:

- a new member is able to get a link from the green button. With this link he/she will be able to refer and get paid even if he/she did not donate at all. 
- a new potential member is able to get updates from WIM and will see how stable the community is.
- this will eliminate membership duration required when the member wants to earn more from WIM. Normally WIM requires that a member be at least 30 days with the community to be a Pay Member.
- WIM will have a comprehensive database and will earn income via advertisements. Earned funds will pay DMDRs, CSDs, FKAs etc.
- Up Liners who manage to register many members [FRs] will have a FR CSD Bonus paid into their accounts on condition that these are genuine new members. This will be test via sms, emails and account quiz to determine if the account belongs to a new member of WIM.

Z : CONTINUOUS DONOR MEMBERS [CDM] AND EFFECTIVE RECRUITER MEMBERS [ERM]

Peers who choose not to recruit for good reasons and opt for creating dreams contunuously are very key to the cash flow of donations. These are not different to the Peers we call Effective Recruiters because both CDM and ERM contribute to the growth of the community.

If a Peer is a CDM he/she will be treated the same. From time to time the minimum dreams and total amount for CDM will be revised just like the minimum number of recruits needed to qualify for ERM status.

AA : Community Contributions 

Excellent Ideas on Consulting Services:

1. I don't start by recruiting my relatives and friends and people in my cycle because they won't take me serious, they will tell me yes I'll join and you'll spend mist of your time chasing after them,its a no no for me period.
2. Save them for later when you're successful, they believe when they see you succeed and they are the ones who will come to you, trust  me I know what I'm talking about.
3. Learn the market plan first,know your target of audience,understand WIM 100%,and start approaching ppl,remember this is a business you, build ur network.
4. Don't be greedy by rushing to get paid, build ur team first because your team will become what you are, be the down liner you want to have I'm your team.
5. When you recruit someone and they say they'll get back to you,stop calling them everyday you'll sound desperate.
6. Be professional speak like a business owner not like a person who wants to pass.
7. Brand yourself(use WIM brands),people want to do business with business owners who take pride about their business.
8. Take care of your down liners, you are nothing without them,motivate them,groom,them,help them because having a demoralized team is as good as having no team at all.

AB : DMDR Hot Spot [DHS]

Why are new platforms liked by many people?

1. They operate on first come first serve, so those who register on the first day of the platform has a high probility of getting his/her first payment within the first period.
2. New Platforms do not have long payment queues for matured dreams.
3. Smart members rig the system by creating many dreams so as to optimize their chances of getting donated to later. This makes many later comers liable to donate to few big matured dreams.
4. Many people want competition and this gives them a market to spread what they term 'investments'.
5. Of course, many flock to new ones to recruit and be leaders so that they earn from bonuses and fund keeping.

Disadvantages:

1. Because they not tested and owners are anonymous no one know how far they ever go or they will ever pay? It is all speculation.
2. There is highly level of scamming and fraud and extremely high risk to members since the platform is new and remember most of the are run by old horses who have learnt from the previous ones how to make the most money from these in an anonymous way. You can judge by their website that it is a true leap in the dark.
3. Late comers are losers.
4. No transparency and there is complete control by Admin and Founders
5. There is no white paper[transparancy] and there is no way of auditing operations to eliminate or minimize scamming or unfairness.

DMDR Hot Spot will take all advantages of new platforms and leave out all disadvantages and extend the current best principles of WIM. It will not milk new comers to feed old members but will build a fair spot where all members have equal chances of winning and losing. It will complement WIM best practices and will not rely on past activities to determine the future.

How will it address past unpaid matured dreams or dreams maturing not paid? It will have nothing to do with past dreams as these will be handled by WIM DCBC and the current activities. It will have the speed of DCBC payments spiced with risk taking. It will scale infinitum. 

Will blocked members and members without DMDRs be allowed to profit from DMDR Hot Spot? This is not a WIM Hot Spot but a WIM DMDR Hot Spot. How are the two different? DMDR Hot Spot will give the donated more credits and more money compared to members who have no matured dreams and are new. This requires all members to now start creating DCBC dreams to pave way for more credits on DMDR Hot Spot.

Advantages of a WD Hot Spot:

1. It will operate on a new clean slate within WIM
2. Anyone, anywhere and anytime will have equal opportunities and will have 67% chance to be donated to within 48 hours :- 25% guaranteed ROI
3. Quick and reliable 24/7 payments with Zero Dololos and Fororos
4. Distributed Fund Keeping with Zero Dololos and Fororos
5. No Admin/Management payments allocations: No queues and no waiting in endless queues because it will be automated.
6. It will scale without degradation because it has no history. this means past Winners are not Future winners and Past Losers are not Future Losers
7. It will be built on transparent rules and will be by far better than pure gambling, lotto, sport batting  or any stockvel in existence
8. There will be Zero scamming and no fraud because everyone will have all the information needed before hand.
9. All those with DMDRs pending payments and who play on the hot spot with clean accounts will have more credits and chances to benefit because WIM believes in sharing wealth.
10. All running public WD Hot Spot Groups will be running on regulated social media chat rooms to eliminate chances of other platforms members crashing WIM and recruiting our members.

AC : HOW TO ELIMINATE UNTRUSTWORTHY PEERS

Peers who when donated to run away from their responsibility to donate to others are often call Fororos and Dololos. They are driven by strong feelings of 'get rich fast and get out before you lose'.

To counterattack this problem the Virtual Distributed P2P must make everyone a Down Liner and also make everyone an Up Liner. Peer = DL + UP. One must be both not one of the two or none of the two. This will bring balanced payments and fairness and will also eliminate a few Up Liners controlling the majority Down Liners.

A true Peer is a community member who does not wait to be served but join others in solving community problems. Learn and master the process of networking. Wise advice follows below
"
Successful Network Marketing is not about pushing , convincing or selling a dream :no_good:♀

:- It's about sharing your message daily and seeking people who connect

:- It's about looking for those who are looking for you 

:- It's about looking for a few "pearls" in a sea of oysters

Remember it takes a few committed and likeminded people to build a massive business 

Filter, sift and sort - look for the pearls - and don't get emotionally attached to the outcomes. :information_desk_person:♀

Fall in love with the process. Be consistent. If you do, the right ones will follow
