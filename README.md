B: AIM OF VIRTUAL DECENTRALIZED P2P CF

Having explained terms now it is easy to move on looking at aims of raising money using this
scheme.

The aims of Virtual Decentralised P2P are:

- solve problems created by Centralized Funding namely: 

a) excludes a significant group of populations those with identity problems, the blacklisted, those with poor credit
ratings and so on.
b) Centralization is secure but very slow and required one to operate with the working hours of the banks. They lack
flexibility.
c) Centralization has many charges and procedures which a Peer to Peer scheme eliminates. One central repository of 
funds is the target of attach and if attach is successful huge funds are lost. This is true with Centralized Stockvels too.
d) P2P scheme is quick, is done anywhere and any time.

Other aims are:

- help each other with finances via free donations and broaden the scope of crowd schemes.
- uplift social and economic status of Peers nationally and internationally.
- minimize volatility and risk.
- create jobs.

and personal verifications.

where ever a Peer is. Eliminates the need to travel to a central place and be subjected to credit worthy judicial panel.
- boost social and psychological states of Peers in social media groups. Common messages like "I have blessed someone today",
"I have been blessed", "Here is my free donation", etc and the virtual social appreciations for actions accomplished.
- bridge digital gap by putting to good use ICT technologies.
- integrate with main stream financial systems.

D: OWNERSHIP:

Almost all Participants of P2P schemes do not want accountability and ownership because each Peer is directly linked 
to the other Peer, funds are personally exchanged without a middle man. The moment it is owned by a person, a company or group
of people then it ceases being decentralized.

E:LEGALITY/LEGIT/Misconceptions:

In spite the fact that it is decentralized and owner less, freedom of expression, association and the freedom to
willingly, knowingly and freely donate and be donated to by legally aged individuals, 
it is well protected by any country democracy.

People often mistakenly take all decentralized financial schemes as illegal Ponzi/Pyramid fraudulent schemes. 
The entire Crypto world and ecosystem reverses centralization, promotes anonymous operations 
and transactions and challenge traditional financial systems and standards

These are very popular and are growing quickly because of the benefits they give to society.

Some of the benefits are listed below:
-Fast, inexpensive and convenient financial operations. Well big companies and some governments have 
 joined the Bitcoin world.
-Virtual Decentralised P2P is a new crowd funding scheme that is based on free donor donation to 
 realize your fellow Peer's dream and is becoming a popular easy financing scheme amidst internet 
 scams, fraud. At some point in time, the law will find a way of dealing with it the same way 
 it will find a way of dealing with Bitcoin or Gambling.

Virtual DP2P Crowd Funding communities need the following to be out of scam parameters:

-eliminate dishonest and misinformation and unnecessary anonymous operations. When an adult gambles his/her 
 salary away in a Casino it is not a scam because of these principles: knowledge, freedom, will and legal age 
 are there. Participating Peers read Terms and Conditions and agree to the platform rules.

G: BENEFICIARIES AND LOSERS:

Any Peer can be a beneficiary and any Peer can be a loser. The higher the risk one takes the higher the 
return when it comes. It is volatile, subscriptions can grow and drop quickly because it based on 
speculation. Earnings via referral links and Consulting Services can offset loses via donations.

because members are socially influenced to bless or be blessed willingly, knowingly and freely.
