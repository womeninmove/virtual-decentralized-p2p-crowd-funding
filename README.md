B: AIM OF VIRTUAL DECENTRALIZED P2P CF

Having explained terms now it is easy to move on looking at aims of raising money using this
scheme.

The aims of Virtual Decentralised P2P are:

- solve problems created by Centralized Funding namely: 

a) excludes a significant group of populations those with identity problems, the blacklisted, those with poor credit
ratings and so on.
b) Centralization is secure but very slow and required one to operate with the working hours of the banks. They lack
flexibility.
c) Centralization has many charges and procedures which a Peer to Peer scheme eliminates. One central repository of 
funds is the target of attach and if attach is successful huge funds are lost. This is true with Centralized Stockvels too.
d) P2P scheme is quick, is done anywhere and any time.

Other aims are:

- help each other with finances via free donations and broaden the scope of crowd schemes.
- uplift social and economic status of Peers nationally and internationally.
- minimize volatility and risk.
- create jobs.

C: OBJECTIVES:

- eliminate delays in Peer to Peer financing. Helping each other quickly without the problem of credit checks
and personal verifications.
- fast, easy and inexpensive interactions and communications. Join, Create dream, get Order, Donate quickly
where ever a Peer is. Eliminates the need to travel to a central place and be subjected to credit worthy judicial panel.
- boost social and psychological states of Peers in social media groups. Common messages like "I have blessed someone today",
"I have been blessed", "Here is my free donation", etc and the virtual social appreciations for actions accomplished.
- bridge digital gap by putting to good use ICT technologies.
- integrate with main stream financial systems.

D: OWNERSHIP:

Almost all Participants of P2P schemes do not want accountability and ownership because each Peer is directly linked 
to the other Peer, funds are personally exchanged without a middle man. The moment it is owned by a person, a company or group
of people then it ceases being decentralized.

E:LEGALITY/LEGIT/Misconceptions:

In spite the fact that it is decentralized and owner less, freedom of expression, association and the freedom to
willingly, knowingly and freely donate and be donated to by legally aged individuals, 
it is well protected by any country democracy.

People often mistakenly take all decentralized financial schemes as illegal Ponzi/Pyramid fraudulent schemes. 
The entire Crypto world and ecosystem reverses centralization, promotes anonymous operations 
and transactions and challenge traditional financial systems and standards

These are very popular and are growing quickly because of the benefits they give to society.

Some of the benefits are listed below:
-Fast, inexpensive and convenient financial operations. Well big companies and some governments have 
 joined the Bitcoin world.
-Virtual Decentralised P2P is a new crowd funding scheme that is based on free donor donation to 
 realize your fellow Peer's dream and is becoming a popular easy financing scheme amidst internet 
 scams, fraud. At some point in time, the law will find a way of dealing with it the same way 
 it will find a way of dealing with Bitcoin or Gambling.

F: SCAM:

"A fraudulent scheme performed by a dishonest individual, group, or company in an attempt obtain 
money or something else of value. Scams traditionally resided in confidence tricks, where an individual 
would misrepresent themselves as someone with skill or authority, i.e. a doctor ... "
[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/scam.html]

Virtual DP2P Crowd Funding communities need the following to be out of scam parameters:

-eliminate dishonest and misinformation and unnecessary anonymous operations. When an adult gambles his/her 
 salary away in a Casino it is not a scam because of these principles: knowledge, freedom, will and legal age 
 are there. Participating Peers read Terms and Conditions and agree to the platform rules.

G: BENEFICIARIES AND LOSERS:

Any Peer can be a beneficiary and any Peer can be a loser. The higher the risk one takes the higher the 
return when it comes. It is volatile, subscriptions can grow and drop quickly because it based on 
speculation. Earnings via referral links and Consulting Services can offset loses via donations.

This is a less risk financial operations compared to national lotto where millions of money is won by 1 person. 
In a Virtual DP2P there is a higher number of members gaining and a higher probability of realising one's dream 
because members are socially influenced to bless or be blessed willingly, knowingly and freely.

H: INFLUENCERS AND POWERS:

Normally recruiters, platform creators, big investors or risk takers, originators have a degree of influence and
power but do not have an ability to control every body because power and finance is decentralized.

I: FEATURES:

i) 	Platform - website for virtual operations.
ii) Participants - Peers to donate and be donated to.
iii)Services:

a) 	Fund Keeping[FK] - This is a service from Peers to keeps funds for the community. Any confirmed Peer qualifies.
	Confirmed means a Participant has completed a verifiable service to build a community e.g. donated, developed 
	website, marketed.
b) 	Consulting Services [CS]- traditionally members were tasked with MLM recruitment but this has evolved 
	to Consulting Services where Down linkers[DL] are assisted as per need until they are independent.
c) 	System Services[SS] - without a web applications being built and maintained the Decentralised P2P ceases to be virtual.
d) 	Mediatory Services[MS] - Social media groups are managed by Peers whose effort should be acknowledged as [MS].
e) 	Financial Services[FK] - These are much needed funds from Peers donated by Financial Service Givers to fund Peer
	dreams. This also includes escrow[ES] services where Fund Keepers are not available and not reliable.
f) 	Other Service Providers [OSP]- These could be counselling[CoS], legal[LeS], spiritual[SpS], educational service[EdS] providers

J: RISKS AND DISADVANTAGES:

This type of funding is similar to gambling. A Participant is not donated to unless and until 
he/she has donated to the community or to a Peer and has been confirmed. The donation made
is done freely, willingly and knowing that it might not have returns but has a speculative 
element of high returns. Donation is not only money, but services too.

Why call it donation not gambling or something like lotto? In gambling, there is a very low probability of wining. In
this P2P donor donated fund raising scheme, there is guaranteed returns to many participants. Lotto is 
pure gambling blessed by law. It has the highest risk ever and millions of lotto players have lost millions of 
money without getting anyone arrested.

The principle of collecting money from many participants to fund a few has been criticised to a point 
that these schemes have evolved to socio-economic models of donor-donated rather that 
investments schemes with ROI.

K: TAX EVASION:

The Virtual Decentralized P2P does not evade tax. It is not a company with income. Participants in their own 
capacity need to solve tax issues as they do with FICA, Know Your Customer in their Peer to Peer financial 
transactions and in their own national laws. It is easy. If ones' donation is doubled or tripled and the person or 
company meets tax requirements then issue of Tax evasion false away.

Since each Peer is fully empowered then it is the Peer who is responsible for all these. Do not equate Virtual Decentralized P2P
to an entity but to a movement to help others with needed funds quickly.

However, Peers should be educated and helped to follow laws and taxes as all other entities of state including 
churches and NPOs.

L: SHORT LEAVED SCHEMES:

Pyramid Schemes and Scam website have been known to be short leaved and to close when there is high demand for 
payouts. Virtual Decentralized P2P Crowd Funding is not money focused but addresses a social key problem and then 
creates a community that grows forever. For example, Women In Move tackles the problem of underrating women and empowering
them socially and economically. 

If adopted by all governments and by all women and supported by all men Women In Move will leave forever.

Embracing the spiritual and social virtues of giving - donating as well
as the economic need to bless other people and see them succeed financial, WIM and its philosophy not only 
breed millionaires but millionaires out of socially and economically disadvantaged groups.

M: HOW WILL THIS BE POSSIBLE:

Virtual Decentralized P2P uses cycles and phases, round robin donations, advanced Fund Keeping and advanced payouts to minimized bottle necks

. Re-donating, prioritized services, eliminating greediness, and creating loyal Peers are but a few ways to 
circumvent quick crashes.

Integrations with Crypto Coin, Peer directed donations and integration with all possible decentralized
financial schemes.

All existing stockvels can double their savings by also enlisting in this scheme to be donated to. This will also 
boost the Virtual Decentralized P2P Crowd Fund Venture.

N: SCOPE OF DONATION:

Financial donations are the base but not the only essential donations. Other donations badly needed are in form of 
services: Financial Advice, Counselling, Legal, Spiritual, Business Networking, Educational, Marketing, ICT, etc.
